**Input** _text.txt_:

First line is the number of elements and the second line is the elements separated by spaces.

The script reads the file line by line and obtains the numbers. The values of the second line are saved in an array of N integers. These values are going to be used to calculate some statistic functions: __Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation__ and __Confidence Intervals__.

The libraries used by these calculations are *numpy* and *scipy*.
