# BasicStatistics

Gived _text.txt_: first line is the number of elements and the second line is the elements separated by spaces.

**Input** _text.txt_:
```bash
14
64630 11735 23360 54216 39233 14170 12345 4978 73429 38120 51135 81230 68660 23360
```

The script reads the file and obtains the numbers. The values of the second line are saved in an array of N integers. These values are going to be used to calculate some statistic functions: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation and Confidence Intervals.

The libraries used by these calculations are **numpy** and **scipy**.
